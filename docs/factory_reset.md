# Factory Reset

If you get a fatal error when you modify the code of keyboard, you can always do a factory reset:

1. Download [factory_reset.uf2](https://gitee.com/makerdiary/python-keyboard/attach_files/469654/download), follow [the firmware upgrade guide](upgrade_firmware.md) to flash `factoary_reset.uf2`. It will erase the storage of the keyboard.

2. Flash the latest firmware from [python-keyboard / firmware](https://github.com/makerdiary/python-keyboard/tree/main/firmware).
